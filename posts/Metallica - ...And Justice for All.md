After the huge success of their previous 3 albums, world-renowned heavy metal band Metallica released their 4th album on August 25th 1988. The album was the first to feature Jason Newstead on bass, after the death of Cliff Burton in 1986.

The track list seems short, with only 9 songs on the record, however with each at least 5 minutes, the album ends up being an hour long journey.
## Tracklist
+ **Blackened** serves as an energetic and driving opener, setting the tone for the tracks to come perfectly. Lyrics such as _"Death of Mother Earth / Never a rebirth"_ are still applicable now, some 35 odd years later.
+ **...And Justice for All**, at 9 minutes long, conveys the main theme of the album, and talks about the failure of justice to protect society. Lyrics like _"Halls of justice painted green, money talking...Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower"_ convey the corruption and abuse the US legal faces, with its effects falling on the common man. Lead singer James Hetfield makes it clear that this is not some foreboding warning, and that he finds this to be _"so grim, so true, so real"_.
+ The military sounding, bass-driven, marching hook of **Eye of the Beholder** switches the focus of the album to war and conflict, a theme which is explored over the next couple songs. The song itself however conveys a different message, describing the censorship and limitations of freedom that are prevalent in society. Hetfield makes his views clear with lyrics such as _"Truth is an offence"_, _"Freedom of choice is made for you my friend/Freedom of speech is words that they will bend"_. Questioning the listener with, _"Do you know what I know? Your money and your wealth/You silence just to hear yourself"_, he again touches on corruption in politics, this time leading to censorship.
+ The central song on the track, and one of the most popular upon release is **One**. Written from the point of view of a terrified soldier at war, the lyrics take you on a journey of his pain during recovery. The song also serves as a shift from the more hard-driving, fast paced riffs of the opening tracks to a more intimate setting.
+ There are also some less notable, although still catchy tracks. **The Shortest Straw** has a quick speedy riff that almost makes the song seem like a chase; **The Frayed Ends of Sanity** sounds closer to a track off their older records, with a cult-like opening chant, and lyrics being followed by a repetitive riff; **Harvester of Sorrow** 
+ The penultimate track is **To Live is To Die**, a heartfelt track and the most intimate on the record. The opening minute's calming acoustic plucks are rudely interrupted by a bashed kick drum that then paves the way for a gruff, solemn bassline. Written as a tribute to late bassist Cliff Burton, the song is a display of the bands heartfelt mourning.
+ **Dyers Eve** closes out the record by reiterating the themes explored previously in a gruff thrashy manner. The lyrics play out as an angry monologue from Hetfield to his parents, who sheltered him at a young age through faith.

## Final Thoughts
This album represents a subtle shift in Metallica's sound, moving from the thrashy, driving tracks from their first 3 albums, to a more refined sound, including some emotional themes. However, their original sound is not lost, and persists, albeit in a more mature sounding fashion.

**Favourite tracks**: Blackened, ...and Justice for All, The Frayed Ends of Sanity, The Shortest Straw, One
